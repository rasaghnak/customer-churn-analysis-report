# **Case Study: Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecom Company**

## **Problem Statement**

Customer churn represents a significant challenge for telecom companies, directly impacting revenue and growth potential. Understanding the factors driving churn and identifying customers at risk is critical for improving customer retention strategies.

This project addresses the challenge of gaining actionable insights into customer churn patterns and predicting future churn risk, using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## **Project Overview**

As a personal learning initiative, I conducted an end-to-end *Customer Churn Analysis* using a publicly available Telecom Churn dataset from Kaggle. The project involved data modeling, predictive analytics, and interactive reporting using Power BI.

---

## **Solution Approach**

The project was executed in four key phases:

### **1. Churned Customer Analysis**

**Objective:**
To understand the characteristics and behavioral patterns of customers who have already churned.

**Approach:**

* Segmented churned customers from the dataset.
* Conducted in-depth analysis of demographic and service usage patterns.
* Presented insights using clear, interactive Power BI visualizations.

---

### **2. Overall Customer Analysis**

**Objective:**
To obtain a holistic view of the entire customer base and key metrics influencing customer experience.

**Approach:**

* Analyzed the complete customer dataset.
* Identified trends and correlations across variables such as tenure, contract type, payment method, and service usage.
* Built interactive dashboards to enable dynamic exploration of customer data.

---

### **3. Risk Analysis of Current (Non-Churned) Customers**

**Objective:**
To proactively identify existing customers who are at a higher risk of churning in the future.

**Approach:**

* Built a predictive Machine Learning (ML) model to classify current customers based on churn risk.
* Applied the model to the non-churned customer segment.
* Visualized risk scores and identified key risk drivers using Power BI dashboards.

---

### **4. Interactive Q\&A Section**

**Objective:**
To enhance business user engagement and enable ad-hoc analysis.

**Approach:**

* Created an interactive Q\&A page in Power BI.
* Allows users to explore the dataset and insights through natural language queries.

---

## **Results Achieved**

* **Actionable Insights:** Identified key factors contributing to customer churn, such as contract type, payment method, and service utilization.
* **Predictive Capability:** Developed an ML model capable of identifying high-risk customers among the current customer base.
* **Interactive Reporting:** Delivered an intuitive, business-friendly Power BI report to support data-driven decision making.
* **Enhanced Business Understanding:** Provided a clear visualization of churn patterns and customer risk profiles to guide retention strategies.

---

## **Challenges Faced**

* **Data Quality:** The raw dataset required significant preprocessing and cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency.
* **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features for the ML model involved careful analysis and iterative tuning.
* **Model Interpretability:** Ensuring that the ML results were understandable and actionable for business users required thoughtful visualization and explanation.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how a structured, data-driven approach can provide valuable insights into customer churn and inform proactive retention strategies. It also showcases the integration of advanced analytics and business intelligence tools (Machine Learning + Power BI) in delivering actionable business outcomes.
